# rock-paper-scissors-v1.0
## The first project in JavaScript Basics from ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).
In this version I used The **Console** *method* **log()** to run automaticaly the program when openning or refreshing the window.

I also used the **alert()** *method* to show the scores and the other different messages, and the **prompt()** *method* to get input from the user.

**Note:** The next step will be The front-end verstion of this project with a UI.
